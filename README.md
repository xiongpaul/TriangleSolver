# TriangleSolver
This project was created for my software quality assurance class during my time attending college.

It is a barebones console application I built with C# that asks for user to input values, then it checks to see if the numeric values will form a triangle shape. If the triangle is formed by the values input by the user then the application will also determine what type of triangle(equilateral, isoceles or scalene) is formed.

This assignment put it's focus mainly on the creation/implementation of unit tests using the nUnit 2.6.4; I would assume that the professor wanted the students to think about what they would test, and to observe how the students implemented those selected tests in their assignment.
